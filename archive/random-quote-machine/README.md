# Random Quote Machine

This is my solution for the Random Quote Machine challenge (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

It uses forismatic.com API to get a random quote, and allows for tweeting any quote, with the ability to truncate quotes longer than 140 characters.

Due to github.io using HTTPS, on modern secure browsers this app can only be demonstrated on http://codepen.io/dapierce/pen/gwaoZJ
