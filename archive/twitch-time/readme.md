# Twitch Time

This is my solution for the Use the Twitchtv JSON API challenge (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

It makes requests to Twitch.tv's API for channel data from an array within the app, and presents that information in a listing of online and offline Twitch.tv streams.
