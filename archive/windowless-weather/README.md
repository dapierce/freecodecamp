# Weather App

This is my solution for the Show the Local Weather challenge (https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

It makes a request for the user's current location, and taps into the Weather Underground API to tell the current weather at your location. Because location is being transmitted, this requires HTTPS for the app to work. Once weather data is downloaded, it is processed and displayed in the correct unit of measure for the country. Before it is shown, a color backdrop is selected based on time of day, and an icon is selected to represent the current conditions. Finally, the page fades into view with the information so that it is all presented as seamlessly as possible.
